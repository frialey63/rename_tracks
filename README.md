# rename_tracks
A simple bash script to simplfy the naming of tracks for a ripped unknown album.
Because sometimes an album may be unknown to all internet CD databases :-(

Usage

Locate the script on your PATH
Create the TXT file in the directory where the tracks are located
Execute the command `rename_tracks.sh <names.txt>`
